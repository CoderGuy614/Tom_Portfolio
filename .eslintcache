 Hi, I’m Tom, a Commercial Photographer from Columbus, Ohio, and I\n            create images of real people in their business environments for\n            advertising, corporate and editorial uses. For three decades, my\n            creative problem-solving skills and ability to work in concert with\n            a team, have led clients to say, I am a great value, worth my weight\n            in a crunch and always welcome on their team. Corporate designers,\n            Communications Directors and Marketing teams value my ability to\n            convey their message in a visually significant and sensitive manor\n            utilizing existing locations and materials. Bringing a project to\n            successful completion on budget requires expertise in lighting,\n            color management, file processing, editing, retouching and the right\n            equipment. Add to that a full understanding of the project from pre\n            to post-production. Photoshop is a joy, from simple retouching to\n            extensive image manipulation and complex compositing, even adding or\n            removing an individual in a group photo.\n          </Card.Text>\n          <hr></hr>\n          <Card.Text className=\"py-2 about-text\">\n            As an Adjunct Professor of Photography, a lecturer and ASMP board\n            member, I mentor students and clients about the value of great\n            images. My education from the University of Wisconsin in painting\n            and The Ohio State University in photography help define my visual\n            language as a storyteller and compelling portraitist. The goal\n            always to visually declutter scenes and evoke the mood of the\n            client’s message with styles tailored to each project. Whether the\n            production takes place in a school, hospital, factory, manufacturing\n            plant, restaurant, assisted living facility, someone’s home or on a\n            farm, I strategically include the environment as an essential\n            character in the visual story.\n          </Card.Text>\n          <hr></hr>\n          <Card.Text className=\"py-2 about-text\">\n            It can be very uncomfortable for people or employees to be in front\n            of a camera, especially when it falls under the category of “duties\n            other”. Most people hate having their picture taken. I get it; being\n            respectful and sensitive to this, I use a lighthearted easy-going\n            manner to build rapport and put subjects at ease. As for executives,\n            I work with tight schedules yet understand the importance and\n            gravity of capturing corporate history. My team and I work\n            efficiently while exercising safety protocols. I love to collaborate\n            in person, though I’m comfortable with tethered capture and\n            live-sharing my screen via zoom for client approval.
